# Staking Initiation

Staking is a core requirement for operating nodes in the DataHive network. It ensures operator commitment, enhances network security, and enables reward distribution. This guide outlines the staking process, requirements, and benefits.

## Overview of Staking

- **Purpose**:
  - Stake tokens to demonstrate commitment to the network.
  - Secure rewards based on performance and contribution.

- **Token Type**:
  - DataHive native tokens are used for staking.

- **Lock-In Period**:
  - Tokens are locked for the duration of node operation and can be withdrawn upon completion of the lock-in period.

## Minimum Staking Requirements

| **Tier** | **Minimum Staking Amount** |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| LN1      | 1,000 tokens               |
| LN2      | 5,000 tokens               |
| LN3      | 10,000 tokens              |
| LN4      | 20,000 tokens              |

*Note: Operators can stake additional tokens above the minimum to increase rewards.*

## Staking Process

1. **Prepare Your Wallet**:
   - Ensure your wallet is compatible with the DataHive platform.
   - See the [wallet compatibility guide](/docs/onboarding/wallets.md) for supported wallets.

2. **Connect Your Wallet**:
   - Visit the [DataHive Staking Portal](https://www.datahive.network/nodes).
   - Connect your wallet using the on-screen prompts.

3. **Stake Tokens**:
   - Enter the number of tokens you wish to stake.
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet to lock tokens for staking.

4. **Verify Staking Status**:

## Benefits of Staking

1. **Earn Rewards**:
   - Staking increases eligibility for [performance rewards](/docs/onboarding/rewards/system.md).

2. **Governance Participation**:
   - Stakers gain voting rights in network proposals and decision-making through the [governance portal](/docs/onboarding/governance/proposals.md).

3. **Boosted Contribution Score**:
   - Staking additional tokens enhances your [network contribution score](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md).

## Unstaking and Withdrawal

1. **Unstaking Process**:
   - Tokens can be unstaked after completing the lock-in period.
   - Navigate to the staking dashboard and select "Unstake."

2. **Withdrawal Timeline**:
   - Tokens are released within 7-14 days after unstaking.
   - Any rewards accrued during the staking period are credited to your wallet.

3. **Penalties**:
   - Early unstaking incurs a penalty, reducing the total tokens returned.

## Staking Best Practices

- **Stake Above Minimum**: Increase rewards by staking additional tokens.
- **Maintain Performance**: Consistently meet [performance metrics](/docs/onboarding/performance/metrics.md) to maximize rewards.
- **Monitor Stake Status**: Regularly check your staking dashboard for updates and alerts.
