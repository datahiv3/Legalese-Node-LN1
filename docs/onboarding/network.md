The DataHive network is a decentralized infrastructure designed to revolutionize legal data management through specialized nodes, blockchain integration, and advanced legal intelligence capabilities.

## Network Architecture

**Node Types**
- [Legalese Nodes (LN)](/docs/onboarding/nodes/legalese.md): Process and validate legal documents
- [Consent Nodes (CN)](/docs/onboarding/nodes/consent.md): Handle consent management
- [Data Assetization Nodes (DN)](/docs/onboarding/nodes/data.md): Transform data into assets
- [Securitization Nodes (SN)](/docs/onboarding/nodes/securitization.md): Manage financial conversions

## Core Components

**Infrastructure Elements**
- Distributed node architecture
- [Legal intelligence layer](/docs/onboarding/intelligence.md)
- [Smart contract system](/docs/onboarding/contracts.md)
- [0G network integration](/docs/onboarding/0g.md)
- [Blockchain validation](/docs/onboarding/validation.md)

## Network Features

**Key Capabilities**
- High-frequency legal decisions
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Automated consent management
- Cross-jurisdictional processing
- Decentralized data ownership

## Integration Points

**System Connections**
- OP Sepolia testnet
- Ethereum mainnet
- 0G decentralized storage
- [External APIs](/docs/onboarding/apis.md)
- [Cross-chain bridges](/docs/onboarding/bridges.md)

## Performance Metrics

**Network Monitoring**
- Node uptime tracking
- Task completion rates
- Validation accuracy
- Network contribution scores
- System resource utilization

*Note: The network is currently in LN1 phase, with gradual deployment of additional node types and features planned for future phases.*
