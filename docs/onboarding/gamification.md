The DataHive network implements a gamification system that rewards [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) based on performance metrics and network contributions.

## Performance Scoring

**Core Metrics**
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md)
- [Task completion rate](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md)
- [Validation accuracy](/docs/onboarding/performance/validation.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md)

## Achievement System

**Milestone Categories**
- [Processing milestones](/docs/onboarding/achievements/processing.md)
- [Validation milestones](/docs/onboarding/achievements/validation.md)
- [Network participation](/docs/onboarding/achievements/participation.md)
- [Quality benchmarks](/docs/onboarding/achievements/quality.md)

## Ranking System

| Performance Tier | [TGE Allocation](/docs/onboarding/tge/allocation.md) Multiplier |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Top 10% | 3.0x base allocation |
| Top 25% | 2.5x base allocation |
| Top 50% | 2.0x base allocation |
| Remaining | 1.0x base allocation |

## Performance Dashboard

**Real-Time Metrics**
- [Performance score](/docs/onboarding/performance/scoring.md)
- [Network ranking](/docs/onboarding/performance/ranking.md)
- [Achievement progress](/docs/onboarding/achievements/progress.md)
- [Quality assessment](/docs/onboarding/performance/quality.md)

## Competitive Elements

**Network Competition**
- Weekly performance leaderboards
- Monthly achievement races
- Quarterly ranking resets
- Special event competitions

## Reward Mechanisms

The gamification system directly influences:
- [Pre-TGE participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) levels
- [Staking rewards](/docs/onboarding/staking/rewards.md)
- [Node tier upgrades](/docs/onboarding/tiers/upgrades.md)
- [Network privileges](/docs/onboarding/privileges.md)

*Note: Performance metrics are calculated and updated in real-time to ensure fair and transparent competition.*
