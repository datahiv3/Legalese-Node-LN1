# Network Contribution

Network contribution is a key metric in the DataHive ecosystem, measuring the overall impact of a node operator's activity on the network's functionality, security, and growth. High contributions are rewarded with increased incentives, better ranking, and greater influence in governance.

## Core Elements of Network Contribution

1. **Task Completion**:
   - Successful execution of assigned tasks such as indexing, validation, and consensus participation.
   - Directly influences network throughput and reliability.

2. **Validation Accuracy**:
   - Ensures processed data meets quality standards.
   - Maintains the integrity and security of the network.

3. **Uptime**:
   - Consistent node availability ensures network resilience and reduces downtime.

4. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Efficient use of computational resources such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth.
   - Nodes with optimized performance contribute more to overall network stability.

5. **Consensus Participation**:
   - Active involvement in network governance and decision-making processes.
   - Improves the decentralized nature of the ecosystem.

6. **Data Integrity**:
   - Contributions to ensuring accurate, reliable, and tamper-proof data storage and processing.

## Contribution Scoring

Each element is scored using a weighted system to calculate a node’s overall network contribution score.

| **Metric**              | **Weight** | **Evaluation Criteria**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task Completion          | 30%        | Percentage of successfully completed tasks                                              |
| Validation Accuracy      | 30%        | Error-free data validation rate                                                        |
| Uptime                   | 20%        | Percentage of time the node remains operational                                         |
| Resource Utilization     | 10%        | Efficient use of computational resources without overloading                            |
| Consensus Participation  | 10%        | Number of votes cast or proposals submitted in governance processes                     |
