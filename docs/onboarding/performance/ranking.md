# Performance Ranking System

The DataHive network implements a comprehensive ranking system that evaluates [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) based on multiple performance metrics and contributions.

## Ranking Tiers

**Diamond Elite (98%+)**
- Maximum rewards and privileges
- Priority task allocation
- Exclusive access to beta features
- 3.0x TGE multiplier
- Network Champion badge eligibility

**Diamond (97-98%)**

- Innovation Leader badge eligibility

## Performance Metrics

**Core Metrics**
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md)
- [Task completion rate](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md)
- [Validation accuracy](/docs/onboarding/performance/validation.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md)

## Ranking Calculation

The ranking score is determined by:
```python
Ranking Score = (Uptime × 0.3) + (Task Completion × 0.3) +
                (Validation Accuracy × 0.2) + (Network Contribution × 0.2)
```

## Evaluation Period

- Rankings updated hourly
- Based on rolling 7-day performance
- Monthly tier adjustments
- Quarterly achievement resets

## Advancement Opportunities

**Rank Improvement**
- Increase node quantity
- Upgrade node tier
- Improve performance metrics
- Enhance network contribution

*Note: Rankings directly influence [TGE participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) and [reward multipliers](/docs/onboarding/rewards/multipliers.md).*
