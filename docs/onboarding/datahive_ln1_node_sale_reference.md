# **General Reference for DataHive LN1 Node Sale**

![alt text](<Group 69.png>)

## 1. Project Overview

**Mission**: The DataHive LN1 Node Sale aims to expand decentralized legal intelligence infrastructure for the [DataHive Network](https://www.datahive.network/nodes) by onboarding node operators through a transparent, performance-based ecosystem. The project integrates advanced cryptoeconomics and gamification to incentivize participation while maintaining operational efficiency and network security.

**Scope**: Legal data indexing, validation, compliance monitoring, and decentralized governance.
