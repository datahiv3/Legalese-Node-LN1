# Resource Alerts in DataHive

Resource alerts in the DataHive network notify node operators of issues related to system resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth. These alerts are crucial for maintaining optimal performance and preventing resource bottlenecks.

---

## Overview of Resource Alerts

Resource alerts provide real-time notifications about:
- High resource utilization.
- Insufficient system capacity.
- Anomalies in resource consumption.

These alerts help operators address issues before they impact task allocation, validation accuracy, or network uptime.

## Types of Resource Alerts

### 1. **CPU Utilization Alerts**
- **Description**: Triggered when CPU usage exceeds defined thresholds.
- **Examples**:
  - Sustained usage above 85% for over 10 minutes.
  - Spikes exceeding 95%.
- **Impact**:
  - High CPU usage can delay task processing and validation.
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Optimize task allocation.
  - Upgrade hardware if necessary.

### 2. **Memory Utilization Alerts**
- **Description**: Triggered by high memory usage or insufficient available memory.
- **Examples**:
  - Available memory below 15% of total capacity.
  - Memory leaks causing rapid depletion.
- **Impact**:
  - May cause task failures or increased latency.
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Restart affected services to free memory.
  - Monitor for potential leaks and optimize applications.

### 3. **Disk Space Alerts**
- **Description**: Warns of low available storage or excessive write activity.
- **Examples**:
  - Disk usage exceeding 90%.
  - Write I/O activity above normal thresholds.
- **Impact**:
  - Insufficient disk space may lead to data loss or task rejection.
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Clear unnecessary files or logs.
  - Expand storage capacity.

### 4. **Bandwidth Utilization Alerts**
- **Description**: Triggered by excessive or unexpected network traffic.
- **Examples**:
  - Sustained bandwidth usage above 80% of capacity.
  - Unusual inbound or outbound traffic spikes.
- **Impact**:
  - May cause delays in data transfer or task validation.
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Investigate potential sources of high traffic.
  - Upgrade network bandwidth if required.

## Alert Severity Levels

| **Severity**  | **Description**                       | **Action Required**                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Critical**  | Immediate risk to node functionality  | Resolve within minutes to prevent downtime.  |
| **High**      | Significant impact on performance     | Address within hours to maintain efficiency. |
| **Medium**    | Moderate impact on resources          | Monitor and resolve within a day.            |
| **Low**       | Informational alerts                  | Take action as needed.                       |

## Alert Delivery Mechanisms

1. **Dashboard Notifications**:
   - Real-time alerts displayed on the [monitoring dashboard](/docs/onboarding/monitoring.md).

2. **Email and SMS**:
   - High and critical severity alerts sent to registered email or phone.

3. **Webhook Integrations**:
   - Configure webhooks to forward alerts to third-party tools (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty).

## Monitoring Resource Alerts

1. **Real-Time Tracking**:
   - Use the [dashboard](/docs/onboarding/dashboard.md) to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and bandwidth usage.

2. **Log Analysis**:
   - Review logs to identify recurring resource issues.

3. **Automated Responses**:
   - Set up scripts to automatically resolve common issues (e.g., clearing cache).

---

## Best Practices for Resource Management

1. **Proactive Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review resource utilization metrics to identify potential bottlenecks.

2. **Optimize Configurations**:
   - Adjust system settings to balance resource usage and performance.

3. **Scale Resources**:
   - Upgrade hardware or allocate additional resources as needed.

4. **Set Custom Thresholds**:
   - Customize alert thresholds based on node tier and workload.

## Troubleshooting Resource Alerts

| **Alert**                  | **Cause**                          | **Resolution**                             |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| High CPU Usage             | Resource-intensive tasks           | Optimize task distribution or upgrade CPU. |
| Low Disk Space             | Excessive log files or data growth | Clear unnecessary files or expand storage. |
| High Bandwidth Utilization | Network traffic spikes             | Investigate source or upgrade bandwidth.   |
