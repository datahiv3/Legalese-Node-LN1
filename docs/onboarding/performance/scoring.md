# Performance Scoring System

The DataHive network implements a comprehensive scoring system to evaluate [node operator](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) performance across multiple metrics.

## Scoring Components

**Core Metrics**
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md): 30% weight
- [Task completion](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md): 30% weight
- [Validation accuracy](/docs/onboarding/performance/validation.md): 20% weight
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md): 20% weight

## Score Calculation

The performance score is calculated using the following formula:

$$ Score = (Uptime × 0.3) + (TaskCompletion × 0.3) + (Validation × 0.2) + (Contribution × 0.2) $$

## Performance Tiers

| Score Range | Tier | Benefits |
|-------------|------|----------|
| 98-100% | Diamond Elite | Maximum rewards, priority tasks |
| 96-97.9% | Diamond | Enhanced rewards, premium status |
| 94-95.9% | Platinum Elite | Increased task allocation |
| 92-93.9% | Platinum | Advanced privileges |
| 90-91.9% | Gold Elite | Enhanced staking benefits |

| 86-87.9% | Silver Elite | Improved standard rewards |
| 85-85.9% | Silver | Standard rewards |
