# Node Performance Monitoring

The DataHive network provides comprehensive monitoring tools for [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) to track performance, maintain uptime, and optimize operations.

## Core Metrics

**System Performance**
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Storage capacity
- Network bandwidth
- Response latency

## Node Health Monitoring

| Metric Type | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Impact |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Uptime | < 98% | < 95% | Reward reduction |
| Task Completion | < 95% | < 90% | Ranking penalty |
| Validation Rate | < 97% | < 93% | Status downgrade |
| Response Time | > 200ms | > 500ms | Task redistribution |
