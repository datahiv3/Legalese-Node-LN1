## Overview

The LN1 Legal Data Indexer is a core component of the DataHive ecosystem, responsible for collecting, processing, and indexing legal documents from various sources. It serves as the primary data ingestion and structuring pipeline for the LN1 node network.

## Core Functionality

### Data Collection üîç
- Automated collection from legal databases and public records
- Support for multiple data source types:
  - Web-based legal repositories
  - Government databases
  - Public legal records
  - Private legal document collections
- Rate-limited and respectful data gathering
- Source attribution and metadata preservation

### Processing Pipeline ‚öôÔ∏è
```python
class ProcessingPipeline:
    def process_document(self):
        return [
            "Document parsing and normalization",
            "Legal entity recognition",
            "Citation extraction and validation",
            "Document classification",
            "Metadata enrichment",
            "Quality assessment"
        ]
```

### Indexing Operations üìä
- Real-time document indexing
- Full-text search capability
- Legal citation indexing
- Relationship mapping
- Version control tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Modular design for extensibility
- Microservice-based components
