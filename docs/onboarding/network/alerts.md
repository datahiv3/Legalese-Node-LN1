# Network Alerts in DataHive

Network alerts in the DataHive ecosystem provide critical notifications to node operators, ensuring timely responses to performance issues, security threats, and compliance requirements. This guide explains the types of alerts, how they function, and best practices for managing them.

---

## Overview of Network Alerts

Network alerts are real-time notifications designed to:
- Inform operators about critical events.
- Enhance system reliability by ensuring quick resolution of issues.
- Maintain compliance with network standards and regulations.

Alerts are categorized based on severity, impact, and recommended actions.

## Types of Alerts

### 1. **Performance Alerts**
- **Description**: Notify operators about performance degradation or potential bottlenecks.
- **Examples**:
  - Uptime falling below 99.9%.
  - Task completion rate dropping below 95%.
  - Increased response times (>200ms).

### 2. **Resource Alerts**
- **Description**: Triggered by resource constraints or abnormal usage patterns.
- **Examples**:
  - High CPU or memory utilization.
  - Insufficient disk space.
  - Bandwidth saturation.

### 3. **Security Alerts**
- **Description**: Highlight potential threats or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Examples**:
  - Failed login attempts.
  - Unusual activity from specific IP addresses.
  - Suspected data breaches.

### 4. **Compliance Alerts**
- **Description**: Warn operators about potential non-compliance with legal or network standards.
- **Examples**:
  - Expired license or KYC verification.
  - Tasks processed without proper consent validation.
  - Missing or incomplete audit logs.

## Alert Severity Levels

| **Severity**  | **Description**                       | **Action Required**                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical**  | Immediate attention required          | Resolve within minutes to avoid penalties.       |
| **High**      | High impact on performance or security| Address within hours to maintain network health. |
| **Medium**    | Moderate impact, but non-urgent       | Resolve within a day to prevent escalation.      |
| **Low**       | Informational alerts                  | Monitor and address as needed.                   |

## Alert Delivery Mechanisms

1. **Dashboard Notifications**:
   - Alerts appear on the [monitoring dashboard](/docs/onboarding/monitoring.md) in real-time.

2. **Email Alerts**:
   - Critical and high-severity alerts are sent directly to the operatorâ€™s registered email.

3. **SMS Notifications** (Optional):
   - Enable SMS alerts for immediate response to critical issues.

4. **Webhook Integrations**:
   - Configure webhooks to forward alerts to third-party systems (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty).

---

## Managing Alerts

1. **Acknowledge Alerts**:
   - Mark alerts as reviewed in the dashboard to track resolved issues.

2. **Prioritize by Severity**:
   - Address critical and high-severity alerts first to minimize impact.

3. **Review Logs**:
   - Use event logs to investigate the root cause of alerts.

4. **Automate Responses**:
   - Configure automated scripts for recurring issues (e.g., restarting services).

## Best Practices for Alert Management

1. **Set Alert Thresholds**:
   - Customize thresholds based on node tier and expected workloads.

2. **Enable All Alert Types**:
   - Ensure comprehensive monitoring by enabling performance, resource, security, and compliance alerts.

3. **Test Alert Mechanisms**:
   - Periodically test alert delivery to ensure notifications are received promptly.

4. **Document Resolutions**:
   - Maintain a log of resolved alerts to identify recurring issues and optimize responses.

## Troubleshooting Common Alerts

| **Alert**                   | **Cause**                                | **Resolution**                           |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Uptime Below Threshold      | Network or hardware issues               | Check network connection and restart node.|
| High CPU Utilization         | Resource-intensive tasks                 | Optimize configurations or upgrade hardware.|
| Failed Consent Validation    | Missing consent or expired terms         | Verify consent records and refresh parameters.|
| Unauthorized Access Attempt | Suspicious login or API call             | Change credentials and review access logs.|
