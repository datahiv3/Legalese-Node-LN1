The DataHive network implements a tiered fee structure for [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) based on node type and performance level. Each fee represents a one-year license issued as an NFT that requires annual renewal to maintain node operation rights.

## License NFT Structure

**Token Details**
- ERC-721 standard NFT
- Contains metadata including license ID, operator address, and expiration date
- Non-transferable for first 12 months
- Integrated with [KYC verification](/docs/onboarding/kyc.md)
- Automated compliance checks

## Annual Fee Structure

| Node Type | Tier Range | Annual License Fee |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| [LN1](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln1.md) | Tier 1-5 | $375.00 - $2,267.86 |
| [LN2](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln2.md) | Tier 6-8 | $2,741.07 - $3,687.50 |
| [LN3](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln3.md) | Tier 9-12 | $4,160.71 - $5,580.36 |
| [LN4](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln4.md) | Tier 13-15 | $6,053.57 - $7,000.00 |

## License Validation

**Network Checks**
- Real-time NFT license verification
- Automated expiration monitoring
- Performance metric tracking
- Compliance status verification

## Renewal Requirements

**Annual Process**
- License expires after 12 months
- Renewal requires full fee payment
- Must maintain compliance status
- Updated KYC verification
- New NFT issuance upon renewal

*Note: Operators must complete renewal process before license expiration to maintain uninterrupted node operation. The network automatically restricts operations for expired or invalid licenses.*
