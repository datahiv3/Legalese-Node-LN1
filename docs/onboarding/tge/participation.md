## Participation Structure

**Base Allocation**
- Initial allocation based on [node tier](/docs/onboarding/tiers/overview.md)
- Performance multipliers applied to base allocation
- Early operator bonus rewards
- Network contribution incentives

## Performance Multipliers

| Performance Category | TGE Multiplier | Requirements |

| Top 10% | 3.0x | 98%+ uptime, Diamond Elite status |
| Top 25% | 2.5x | 95%+ uptime, Platinum status |
