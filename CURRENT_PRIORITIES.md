# Current Development Priorities for LN1 Legalese Node

This document outlines the current development priorities for the LN1 Legalese Node project. It serves as a public guide for the DataHive development team, as well as current and prospective contractors.


## Primary Focus Areas

1. Legal Data Indexing and Curation System
2. Blockchain Integration
3. Performance Optimization

## 1. Legal Data Indexing and Curation System

Our main priority for LN1 is establishing the foundational infrastructure for web-based legal data indexing and curation. For detailed technical specifications and implementation details, see [LEGAL_DATA_SYSTEM.md](/docs/technical/LEGAL_DATA_SYSTEM.md). This includes:

- Implementing efficient web scraping for:
  - Cookie policies
  - Privacy policies
  - Terms of service
  - Legal notices
  - Website compliance documents
- Building extensible data structures that support future NLP integration (LN2-LN5)
- Creating base schemas for Legal Data Dictionary and Taxonomy
- Implementing basic validation and compliance checks

### Key Tasks:
- Build robust web scraping infrastructure
- Develop modular architecture for future extensibility
- Create flexible storage schemas
- Implement basic text processing functionality
- Design APIs that support future NLP integration

## 2. Blockchain Integration

We aim to seamlessly integrate the indexing and curation system with our blockchain infrastructure. For detailed information about our testnet deployment, see [DataHive's Testnet1 Launch Announcement](https://www.datahive.network/post/datahive-launches-testnet1-on-op-sepolia-facilitated-by-altlayer-advancing-integration-with-0g-aios).

### Storage Strategy
- Implementing 0G (Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Governance) as primary storage through AIOS integration
- Utilizing OP Sepolia testnet infrastructure facilitated by AltLayer
- Designing modular storage interfaces for future integrations (IPFS, etc.)
- Optimizing data structures for efficient 0G integration

### Key Tasks:
- Develop and test smart contracts for data integrity on OP Sepolia
- Implement efficient on-chain and off-chain storage solutions using AltLayer's RaaS
- Create robust APIs for blockchain component interaction
- Design flexible storage interfaces for future platform integration

### Integration Points:
- AltLayer's Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) infrastructure
- 0G's AIOS (Decentralized AI Operating System)
- OP Sepolia testnet environment
- DataHive's Testnet1 infrastructure

## 3. Performance Optimization

Performance is our primary focus for LN1, taking precedence over advanced security features (which will be addressed in LN2):

### Key Performance Areas:
- Web scraping efficiency
- Data processing speed
- Storage read/write operations
- Query response times
- System resource utilization

### Performance Metrics:
- Scraping throughput
- Processing latency
- Storage operation speed
- API response times
- Resource usage statistics

## Open Source Commitment

We prioritize free and open-source resources across our stack:
- Open-source web scraping libraries
- Free API alternatives where possible
- Community-driven development tools
- Open-source storage solutions

## Note on Future Development

While LN1 focuses on core infrastructure and performance, future versions (LN2-LN5) will address:
- Advanced NLP capabilities
- Enhanced security features
- Additional storage integrations
- Advanced ML/AI features

This approach ensures we build a solid foundation in LN1 while maintaining extensibility for future enhancements.
