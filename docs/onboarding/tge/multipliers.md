# TGE Participation Multipliers

The DataHive network implements a performance-based multiplier system that determines [TGE participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) benefits based on node operation excellence and network contribution.

## Multiplier Structure

| Performance Tier | Multiplier | Requirements |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Top 10% | 3.0x | 98%+ uptime, Diamond Elite status |
| Top 25% | 2.5x | 95%+ uptime, Platinum status |
| Top 50% | 2.0x | 90%+ uptime, Gold status |
| Remaining | 1.0x | Basic participation |

## Performance Metrics

**Evaluation Criteria**
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md)
- [Task completion rate](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md)
- [Validation accuracy](/docs/onboarding/performance/validation.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md)

## Multiplier Calculation

The TGE multiplier is determined by:
- Performance ranking in network
- Achievement level status
- Continuous operation time
- Quality of contributions

## Maintenance Requirements

**Status Preservation**
- Maintain required uptime
- Meet task completion quotas
- Achieve validation accuracy targets
- Contribute to network consensus
- Participate in legal intelligence development

*Note: Multipliers are evaluated on a rolling 7-day basis and may adjust based on performance metrics.*
