# Node Operations Guide

The DataHive network provides comprehensive operational guidelines for [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) to ensure optimal performance and network contribution.

## Core Operations

**Daily Tasks**
- Monitor node uptime and performance
- Process legal document indexing requests
- Validate network transactions
- Participate in consensus mechanisms
- Maintain system resources

## Performance Requirements

| Metric | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Uptime | 99.9% | < 98% | < 95% |
| Task Completion | 98% | < 95% | < 90% |
| Validation Rate | 99% | < 97% | < 93% |
| Response Time | < 100ms | > 200ms | > 500ms |

## Resource Management

**System Monitoring**
- CPU utilization optimization
- Memory usage tracking
- Storage capacity management
- Network bandwidth allocation
- Performance metric logging

## Maintenance Procedures

**Regular Tasks**
- [Software updates](/docs/onboarding/updates.md)
- [Security patches](/docs/onboarding/security/patches.md)
- [Performance optimization](/docs/onboarding/performance/optimization.md)
- [Backup procedures](/docs/onboarding/backup.md)
- [Log rotation](/docs/onboarding/logs.md)

## Task Delegation

**Workload Distribution**
- Higher tier nodes receive more complex tasks
- Advanced hardware configurations enable greater workload
- Performance history influences task allocation
- Network contribution affects delegation priority

## Operational Security

**Security Measures**
- Implement [2FA](/docs/onboarding/security/2fa.md)
- Maintain secure key storage
- Regular security audits
- Network access controls
- Incident response procedures

*Note: Operators must maintain these operational standards to ensure optimal network performance and maximize rewards.*
