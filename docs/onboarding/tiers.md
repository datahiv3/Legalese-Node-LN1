The [DataHive network](/docs/onboarding/network.md) operates on a [tiered system](/docs/onboarding/tiers/overview.md) where each tier has specific [hardware requirements](/docs/onboarding/hardware.md), [fees](/docs/onboarding/fees.md), and [staking factors](/docs/onboarding/staking/factors.md).

## Staking Factor Explained

The [staking factor](/docs/onboarding/staking/factors.md) is a multiplier applied to the [node fee](/docs/onboarding/fees.md) to determine the required [stake amount](/docs/onboarding/staking/requirements.md) for each tier. For example:
- At [Tier 1](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln1.md), with a staking factor of 0.75, an operator must stake 75% of their node fee ($375.00 × 0.75 = $281.25)
- At [Tier 15](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln4.md), with a staking factor of 3.0, an operator must stake 300% of their node fee ($7,000.00 × 3.0 = $21,000.00)

The staking factor increases progressively with each tier for several important reasons:
- **[Network Security](/docs/onboarding/security/network.md)**: Higher tiers process more sensitive data, requiring larger stakes to deter malicious behavior
- **[Commitment Level](/docs/onboarding/staking/commitment.md)**: Increased stakes demonstrate stronger commitment to network operations
- **[Risk Management](/docs/onboarding/risk/management.md)**: Larger stakes protect against potential disruptions in higher-capacity nodes
