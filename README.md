## ðŸš€ Why LN1?

- **Decentralized Processing**: Leverage the power of distributed nodes for legal data processing
- **AI-Powered**: Integrated with 0G AIOS for intelligent data analysis
- **Scale with Confidence**: Built on OP Sepolia for high performance and reliability
- **Developer First**: Rich APIs and comprehensive SDKs for seamless integration


## Development Roadmap

LN1 development is following a phased approach outlined in our [Core Development Project](https://github.com/orgs/datahiv3/projects/3). Phase 1 focuses on implementing the foundational components of the Legal Data Indexing and Curation system, including:

- Core indexer and curator functionality
- Storage layer implementation
- Initial API endpoints
- Basic infrastructure for legal document processing

You can track our development progress and upcoming milestones on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/datahiv3/projects/3).
