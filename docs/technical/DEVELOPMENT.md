## Development Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the development process within the DataHive network, detailing best practices and essential tools for developers.

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have the latest versions of Node.js and Python installed.
   - Install Docker for containerized application management.

2. **Repository Cloning**
   - Clone the DataHive repository from GitHub using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo/datahive.git
     ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy the example environment file and configure necessary variables:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use GitFlow for managing branches:
     - **Main**: Stable production-ready code.
     - **Develop**: Integration branch for features.
     - **Feature**: Individual branches for new features or fixes.

2. **Coding Standards**
   - Follow the coding guidelines outlined in `/docs/guidelines/coding.md`.
   - Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript code formatting.

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests using Jest for JavaScript components.
   - Use PyTest for testing Python modules.

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions:
     - Automate testing and deployment processes.
     - Ensure code passes all checks before merging.

### Tools and Resources

- **IDE Setup**: Recommended IDEs include Visual Studio Code and PyCharm.
- **Documentation**: Access API documentation in the `/docs/api` folder.
- **Security Guidelines**: Follow security best practices outlined in `/docs/security`.

### Best Practices

- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to maintain quality.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes frequently with clear messages.
- **Collaboration**: Use GitHub Issues and Projects for task management.
