The [DataHive network](/docs/onboarding/network.md) implements a sophisticated [tokenomics model](/docs/onboarding/tokenomics/overview.md) that rewards [Legalese Node](/docs/onboarding/nodes/legalese.md) operators through multiple mechanisms.

## Core Function Rewards

**Primary Revenue Streams**
- [Legal data indexing](/docs/onboarding/functions/indexing.md) and [curation](/docs/onboarding/functions/curation.md)
- [Document processing](/docs/onboarding/functions/processing.md) and [validation](/docs/onboarding/functions/validation.md)
- [Compliance monitoring](/docs/onboarding/functions/compliance.md)
- [Network consensus](/docs/onboarding/consensus.md) participation
- [Legal intelligence](/docs/onboarding/intelligence.md) contribution

## Performance-Based Incentives

The [reward system](/docs/onboarding/rewards/system.md) operates on a curved grading mechanism where operators are evaluated based on:

**Evaluation Metrics**
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md) and reliability
- [Task completion](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md) accuracy
- [Processing speed](/docs/onboarding/performance/speed.md) and efficiency
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/performance/contribution.md) quality
- [Validation consensus](/docs/onboarding/performance/consensus.md) participation

## Pre-TGE Benefits

The [pre-TGE participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) rewards scale exponentially with performance:

| [Performance Tier](/docs/onboarding/performance/tiers.md) | [TGE Allocation](/docs/onboarding/tge/allocation.md) Multiplier |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Top 10% | 3.0x base allocation |
| Top 25% | 2.5x base allocation |
| Top 50% | 2.0x base allocation |
| Remaining | 1.0x base allocation |

## Gamification Elements

**[Performance Dashboard](/docs/onboarding/dashboard.md)**
- [Real-time metrics](/docs/onboarding/monitoring/metrics.md)
- [Comparative rankings](/docs/onboarding/performance/rankings.md)
- [Achievement milestones](/docs/onboarding/rewards/achievements.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/performance/scoring.md) scores
- [Quality assessment](/docs/onboarding/performance/quality.md) grades

The [gamification system](/docs/onboarding/gamification.md) encourages healthy competition while maintaining network security through:
- [Transparent scoring](/docs/onboarding/scoring/transparency.md) mechanisms
- [Fair reward](/docs/onboarding/rewards/distribution.md) distribution
- [Clear performance](/docs/onboarding/performance/metrics.md) metrics
- Regular [performance assessments](/docs/onboarding/performance/assessment.md)

*Note: Detailed [TGE participation allocations](/docs/onboarding/tge/details.md) and exact multipliers will be announced closer to the token generation event.*
