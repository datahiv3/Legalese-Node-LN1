# Knowledge Validation System

## Overview

The KnowledgeValidation module ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of legal data across the DataHive ecosystem. This component maintains the integrity and trustworthiness of the Legal Intelligence Layer through multi-node verification.

## Core Components

### Validation Reports
- Node-submitted approval/rejection indicators
- Detailed feedback and improvement suggestions
- Aggregated validation outcomes
- Performance tracking metrics

### Consensus Mechanism
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on:
  - Document complexity
  - Network conditions
  - Historical performance
  - Validation urgency

## Validation Processes

### Multi-Node Validation
```python
class ValidationProcess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validators = []
        self.threshold = 0.75  # 75% consensus required

    async def validate_entry(self, legal_data):
        reports = await self.collect_validations(legal_data)
        consensus = self.calculate_consensus(reports)
        return self.finalize_validation(consensus)
```

### Dynamic Threshold Management
- Real-time analysis of validation patterns
- Historical node performance consideration
- Document complexity assessment
- Network health monitoring

## Integration Points

### Legal Intelligence Layer
- Synchronization with knowledge graph
- Pattern recognition validation
- Cross-reference verification
- Citation chain validation

### Data Management
- Version control tracking
- Change history maintenance
- Conflict resolution protocols
- Update propagation management

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- Syntax validation
- Completeness verification
