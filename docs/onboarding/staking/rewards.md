# Staking Rewards

The [DataHive network](/docs/onboarding/network.md) implements a [pre-TGE staking](/docs/onboarding/staking/pre-tge.md) reward system that incentivizes early [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) through [TGE participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) benefits.

## Pre-TGE Staking Structure

**Participation Benefits**
- Early node operators receive [priority access](/docs/onboarding/tge/priority.md) to TGE
- [Participation allocation](/docs/onboarding/tge/allocation.md) increases exponentially with tier level
- Higher tiers receive proportionally larger [TGE allocations](/docs/onboarding/tge/distribution.md)

## Reward Calculation

The [staking rewards](/docs/onboarding/staking/rewards.md) are determined by:
- [Node tier level](/docs/onboarding/tiers/overview.md) (LN1-LN4)
- Duration of [pre-TGE operation](/docs/onboarding/operations/pre-tge.md)
- [Node performance metrics](/docs/onboarding/performance/metrics.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md)

## Tier-Based Allocation

| [Node Type](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) | [Tiers](/docs/onboarding/tiers/overview.md) | [TGE Participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| [LN1](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln1.md) | 1-5 | Base allocation |
| [LN2](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln2.md) | 6-8 | Enhanced allocation |
| [LN3](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln3.md) | 9-12 | Premium allocation |
| [LN4](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln4.md) | 13-15 | Maximum allocation |

## Performance Metrics

[Reward multipliers](/docs/onboarding/rewards/multipliers.md) are based on:
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md)
- [Task completion rate](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md)
- [Validation accuracy](/docs/onboarding/performance/validation.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md)

*Note: Detailed [TGE participation allocations](/docs/onboarding/tge/allocation.md) will be announced closer to the token generation event.*
