The DataHive network implements a performance-based delegation system where nodes with higher tiers and better hardware capabilities receive proportionally more tasks and rewards.

## Task Delegation Structure

**Higher Tier Benefits**
- More complex legal data processing tasks
- Increased validation responsibilities
- Priority task allocation
- Enhanced network privileges

## Hardware-Based Allocation

| Node Type | Processing Capacity | Task Allocation | Reward Potential |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| LN4 (Tier 13-15) | Highest (64GB RAM, Dual Xeon) | Maximum workload | Highest rewards |
| LN3 (Tier 9-12) | Advanced (16-32GB RAM, Xeon/EPYC) | High workload | Enhanced rewards |
| LN2 (Tier 6-8) | Intermediate (16GB RAM, i9/Ryzen 9) | Moderate workload | Standard rewards |
| LN1 (Tier 1-5) | Basic (4-16GB RAM, i5-i7/Ryzen 5-7) | Base workload | Base rewards |

## Performance Incentives

The [delegation algorithm](/docs/onboarding/delegation.md) automatically assigns more tasks to nodes that demonstrate:
- Consistent high performance
- Superior hardware capabilities
- Higher tier status
- Proven reliability

This ensures that nodes with greater capabilities are fully utilized while being compensated proportionally for their enhanced contribution to the network.
