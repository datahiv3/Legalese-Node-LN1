# Node Operator Profiles

The DataHive network supports different types of [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) with varying scales of operation and requirements.

## Individual Operators

**Key Characteristics**
- Single or small number of nodes
- Direct management of operations
- Personal hardware setup
- Basic monitoring requirements

## Enterprise Operators

**Key Features**
- Multiple node management
- [Cluster organization](/docs/onboarding/clusters.md)
- Advanced monitoring tools
- Customized legal agreements
- Dedicated support access

## Operational Structure

| Profile Type | Node Scale | Management Level | Hardware Requirements |
|-------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Individual | 1-5 nodes | Basic | [Standard specs](/docs/onboarding/hardware.md) |
| Small Enterprise | 6-20 nodes | Intermediate | [Enhanced specs](/docs/onboarding/hardware.md) |
| Large Enterprise | 20+ nodes | Advanced | [Enterprise specs](/docs/onboarding/hardware.md) |

## Performance Requirements

**Individual Operators**
- Maintain minimum 95% uptime
- Complete basic validation tasks
- Participate in network consensus
- Follow standard compliance protocols

**Enterprise Operators**
