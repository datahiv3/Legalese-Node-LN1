# Consent Nodes (CN)

Consent Nodes (CN) are a specialized type of node within the DataHive network that manage user consent mechanisms and ensure compliance with privacy and data-sharing regulations. These nodes play a critical role in maintaining transparency and trust in the ecosystem.

## Core Functions of Consent Nodes

1. **Consent Management**:
   - Process, record, and update user consent preferences.

2. **Consent Validation**:
   - Validate incoming consent requests against stored permissions.

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Maintain tamper-proof logs of consent activities for compliance and accountability.

4. **Integration with Legal Parameters**:
   - Align user consent mechanisms with regional and global data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

5. **User Consent Tracking**:
   - Ensure consent histories are securely stored and easily retrievable for auditing purposes.

## Key Features

- **Tamper-Proof Records**:
   - Consent histories are stored securely using blockchain technology, ensuring immutability.

- **Real-Time Validation**:
   - Instant validation of consent requests to support seamless data-sharing workflows.

- **Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance**:
   - Built to adapt to regional legal requirements for data privacy and consent.

- **User-Centric Design**:
   - Empowers users with full control over their consent preferences.

## Consent Node Performance Metrics

| **Metric**                | **Target**         | **Impact of Non-Compliance**                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Consent Validation Rate   | >99%              | Reduced rewards and task reallocation            |
| Processing Speed          | <100ms            | Slower response times may lead to penalties      |
| Audit Log Integrity       | 100% tamper-proof | Invalidation of logs may result in suspension    |

## Use Cases for Consent Nodes

1. **Data Sharing Agreements**:
   - Validate whether a user has consented to share specific data with third parties.

2. **Compliance Monitoring**:
   - Ensure all data transactions comply with user-defined consent preferences.

3. **Auditable Records**:
   - Provide regulators and stakeholders with verifiable consent logs.

4. **Dynamic Consent Updates**:
   - Enable users to modify or revoke consent in real-time.
