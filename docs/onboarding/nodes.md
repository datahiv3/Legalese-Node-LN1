The DataHive network consists of specialized nodes that form the decentralized infrastructure for legal data management and processing.

## Core Node Types

**Legalese Nodes (LN)**
- Process and validate legal documents
- Maintain legal intelligence layer
- Index and curate legal data
- Handle compliance monitoring
- Support smart contract integration

**Consent Nodes (CN)**
- Manage consent mechanisms
- Process user permissions
- Track consent history
- Validate consent requests
- Integrate with legal parameters

**Data Assetization Nodes (DN)**
- Transform data into assets
- Process data valuations
- Handle data tokenization
- Manage data ownership
- Track data transactions

**Securitization Nodes (SN)**
- Convert data to financial assets
- Process securitization requests
- Manage asset validation
- Handle token distribution
- Monitor asset performance
