# Pre-TGE Staking

The DataHive network implements a pre-TGE (Token Generation Event) staking mechanism that incentivizes early [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) through enhanced participation benefits.

## Staking Structure

**Base Requirements**
- Minimum stake amount determined by [tier level](/docs/onboarding/tiers/overview.md)
- Stake must be maintained throughout pre-TGE period
- Staking duration affects [TGE participation](/docs/onboarding/tge/participation.md) multiplier
- Performance metrics influence final allocation

## Participation Benefits

**TGE Allocation Multipliers**
| Performance Tier | Multiplier | Requirements |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Top 10% | 3.0x | 98%+ uptime, Diamond Elite status |
| Top 25% | 2.5x | 95%+ uptime, Platinum status |
| Top 50% | 2.0x | 90%+ uptime, Gold status |
| Remaining | 1.0x | Basic participation |

## Performance Metrics

**Evaluation Criteria**
- [Node uptime](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md)
- [Task completion rate](/docs/onboarding/performance/tasks.md)
- [Network contribution](/docs/onboarding/network/contribution.md)
- [Quality assessment](/docs/onboarding/performance/quality.md)

## Staking Periods

**Duration Benefits**
- Minimum 3-month commitment required
- Additional multipliers for longer commitments
- Early staker bonus for first 1000 nodes
- Loyalty rewards for continuous operation

## Lock-up Requirements

**Post-TGE Rules**
- Mandatory 12-month lock-up period
- Graduated unlocking schedule
- Performance-based early release options
- Continued operation incentives

*Note: Detailed TGE participation rules and final multipliers will be announced closer to the token generation event.*
