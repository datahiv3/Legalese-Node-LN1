# DataHive Data Governance Framework

The DataHive data governance framework establishes protocols and standards for managing legal data across the distributed network, ensuring compliance, quality, and ethical data handling practices.

## Core Components

### Data Quality Management
- Data accuracy verification
- Completeness assessment
- Consistency validation
- Timeliness monitoring

### Compliance Framework
```python
class GovernanceValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.compliance_rules = ComplianceRules()
        self.quality_metrics = QualityMetrics()
        self.audit_trail = AuditTrail()

    async def validate_governance(self, data_entry):
        compliance = await self.check_compliance(data_entry)
        quality = self.assess_quality(data_entry)
        return self.generate_report(compliance, quality)
```
