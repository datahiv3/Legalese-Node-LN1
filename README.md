# About LN1

The LN1 Legalese Node is a crucial component of the DataHive ecosystem, designed to index, curate, and process legal data in a decentralized manner. It plays a key role in building and maintaining the Legal Intelligence Layer of the DataHive network.

## Development Roadmap

LN1 development is following a phased approach outlined in our [Core Development Project](https://github.com/orgs/datahiv3/projects/3). Phase 1 focuses on implementing the foundational components of the Legal Data Indexing and Curation system, including:

- Core indexer and curator functionality
- Storage layer implementation
- Initial API endpoints
- Basic infrastructure for legal document processing

You can track our development progress and upcoming milestones on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/datahiv3/projects/3).

## Current Development Focus

We are actively working on Phase 1 of the LN1 Core Development, which establishes the basic infrastructure for:
- Legal document processing and indexing
- Data validation protocols
- Storage layer components
- Initial API endpoints

For detailed information about our current priorities and development focus, please refer to our [Current Priorities](CURRENT_PRIORITIES.md) document.
