# Task Delegation System

The DataHive network uses a performance-based task delegation system to ensure efficient processing and equitable distribution of workload among nodes. This system prioritizes high-performing nodes while incentivizing improvements across all operators.

## How Task Delegation Works

1. **Performance-Based Allocation**:
   - Tasks are distributed based on key performance metrics such as uptime, task completion rate, and validation accuracy.

2. **Tier-Based Complexity**:
   - Higher-tier nodes receive more complex and resource-intensive tasks, reflecting their advanced capabilities.

3. **Geographic Considerations**:
   - Tasks may be allocated based on geographic proximity to improve network efficiency.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Task allocation adjusts dynamically to reflect changes in performance metrics.

## Task Allocation Criteria

| **Criterion**             | **Weight** | **Description**                                          |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Uptime                   | 40%        | Nodes with higher uptime are prioritized.               |
| Task Completion Rate     | 30%        | Completion of tasks without errors boosts allocation.   |
| Validation Accuracy      | 20%        | Accurate validation ensures critical task assignments.  |
| Hardware Capability      | 10%        | Advanced hardware enables assignment of complex tasks.  |

## Task Types by Node Tier

| **Tier** | **Task Type**                | **Complexity Level** | **Reward Multiplier** |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| LN1      | Basic indexing and validation | Low                  | 1.0x                  |
| LN2      | Intermediate processing       | Moderate             | 2.0x                  |
| LN3      | Advanced validation tasks     | High                 | 2.5x                  |
| LN4      | Complex legal data processing | Very High            | 3.0x                  |

## Benefits of Performance-Based Delegation

1. **Efficiency**:
   - Ensures tasks are completed quickly and accurately by matching them to suitable nodes.

2. **Incentivized Upgrades**:
   - Encourages operators to upgrade hardware and maintain high performance to secure more tasks.

3. **Fairness**:
   - Balances task distribution based on contribution and reliability.

## Monitoring Task Delegation

1. **Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Operators can view assigned tasks and their status via the [DataHive Dashboard](/docs/onboarding/dashboard.md).

2. **Task History**:
   - Detailed logs provide insights into past allocations and performance metrics.

3. **Alerts**:
   - Notifications are sent for task assignment changes or performance dips.

## Strategies for Maximizing Task Allocation

1. **Improve Uptime**:
   - Maintain >99.9% uptime to maximize priority in task delegation. See the [uptime guide](/docs/onboarding/performance/uptime.md).

2. **Enhance Task Accuracy**:
   - Use tools and best practices to minimize errors. Learn more in the [performance metrics guide](/docs/onboarding/performance/metrics.md).

3. **Upgrade Hardware**:
   - Align hardware capabilities with higher-tier requirements for increased task allocation. Refer to [hardware specifications](/docs/onboarding/hardware.md).

4. **Monitor Metrics**:
   - Regularly review performance metrics and address any flagged issues promptly.

## Penalties for Low Performance

| **Issue**                 | **Impact**                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Low Uptime                | Reduction in task allocation priority.      |
| High Error Rate           | Tasks reassigned to other operators.        |
| Non-Compliance            | Suspension from task distribution.          |

## Governance and Feedback

Operators are encouraged to participate in governance discussions to propose improvements to the delegation system. Submit your suggestions through the [governance portal](/docs/onboarding/governance/proposals.md).
