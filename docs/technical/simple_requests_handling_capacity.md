# Simple Requests Handling Capacity in LN1 Legalese Node

The LN1 Legalese Node is designed to handle a high volume of simple RPC requests efficiently. Under standard hardware conditions, a single node can process approximately **100 simple requests per second**, ensuring reliable performance for most applications.

## **What Are Simple Requests?**

Simple requests are lightweight JSON-RPC calls that require minimal computational resources. Examples include:
- `eth_blockNumber`: Retrieves the latest block number.
- `net_version`: Returns the network ID.
- `web3_clientVersion`: Provides information about the client version.

These requests typically involve querying the current state of the blockchain or node without requiring extensive data processing or historical lookups.

## **Hardware Conditions for This Capacity**

The estimated handling capacity of 100 requests per second is based on the following standard hardware specifications:
- **CPU**: Quad-core processor (3.2 GHz or higher).
- **RAM**: 16 GB (32 GB recommended for better performance).
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 1 TB capacity.
- **Network**: Minimum 1 Gbps connection.

Nodes deployed on hardware exceeding these specifications may achieve higher throughput.

## **Factors Affecting Request Handling Capacity**

1. **Request Complexity**:
   - Simple requests like `eth_blockNumber` are processed faster than resource-intensive calls (e.g., `eth_getLogs` or `debug_traceTransaction`).

2. **Concurrent Connections**:
   - High numbers of simultaneous connections may reduce per-request performance.

3. **Network Latency**:
   - Slow network connections can impact response times and overall throughput.

4. **Node Configuration**:
   - Misconfigured nodes may underperform. Ensure optimal settings for hardware and software.

5. **System Load**:
   - Background processes or other applications running on the same hardware can affect node performance.

## **Best Practices for Optimizing Request Handling**

1. **Use Caching for Frequently Accessed Data**:
   - Cache responses for methods like `eth_blockNumber` to reduce redundant queries.

2. **Batch Requests When Possible**:
   - Combine multiple simple requests into a single batch to minimize overhead.

3. **Monitor Node Performance**:
   - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track request rates, CPU usage, and memory consumption.

4. **Scale Horizontally**:
   - Deploy multiple nodes behind a load balancer to distribute traffic and increase overall capacity.

5. **Optimize Client Applications**:
   - Reduce unnecessary polling by implementing event-driven architectures where possible.

## **Example Usage**

### Single Request Example
#### Request:
```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_blockNumber",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}
```
#### Response:
```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x10d4f", // Block number in hexadecimal
  "id": 1
}
```

### Batch Request Example
#### Request:
```
[
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_blockNumber", "params": [], "id": 1},
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "net_version", "params": [], "id": 2}
]
```
#### Response:
```
[
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "0x10d4f", "id": 1},
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "1", "id": 2}
]
```
