## üéØ Overview

The LN1 Curator is a critical component of the DataHive ecosystem, ensuring the quality, accuracy, and reliability of legal data through advanced curation processes. Track our development progress on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/datahiv3/projects/3).

## ‚ö° Core Features

- **Real-time Validation**: Automated checks for data accuracy and completeness
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layer verification system
- **Smart Classification**: AI-powered legal document categorization
- **Version Control**: Complete history of document changes
- **Compliance Tracking**: Automated regulatory compliance checks

## üîÑ Curation Workflow

```python
class CurationProcess:
    def curate_document(self, document):
        return [
            "Validate document structure and content",
            "Extract and verify metadata",
            "Classify legal context and jurisdiction",
            "Apply quality control checks",
            "Generate verification proof",
            "Store with version control"
        ]
```

### Validation Steps
1. **Initial Check**: Document structure and format validation
2. **Content Analysis**: Legal text and reference verification
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Automated metadata generation
4. **Quality Control**: Multi-node validation system
5. **Final Verification**: Consensus-based approval
