# Node Tier Overview

The DataHive network categorizes nodes into distinct tiers based on their hardware capabilities, performance potential, and reward multipliers. This tiered system ensures efficient task delegation and incentivizes operators to scale their infrastructure for maximum contributions to the network.

## Tier Classifications

| **Tier** | **Range**        | **Hardware Requirements**            | **Annual Fee**         | **Reward Multiplier** |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| LN1      | 1-5             | Basic (4-16GB RAM, i5/i7, SSD)       | $375 - $2,268          | 1.0x                  |
| LN2      | 6-8             | Intermediate (16GB RAM, Ryzen 9)     | $2,741 - $3,688        | 2.0x                  |
| LN3      | 9-12            | Advanced (32GB RAM, Xeon/EPYC)       | $4,161 - $5,580        | 2.5x                  |
| LN4      | 13-15           | Enterprise (64GB RAM, Dual Xeon)     | $6,054 - $7,000        | 3.0x                  |

## Tier Benefits

1. **Task Allocation**: Higher-tier nodes receive more complex and higher-paying tasks, ensuring scalability aligns with operational effort.
2. **Performance Rewards**: Reward multipliers increase significantly with tier level, boosting potential ROI.
3. **Network Privileges**: Higher-tier nodes gain priority in task delegation and greater influence in network governance.
4. **TGE Participation**: Top-tier nodes secure increased allocations in Token Generation Events (TGE).

## Upgrade Opportunities

Node operators can upgrade to higher tiers by:
- Enhancing their hardware to meet the specifications of the target tier.
- Paying the applicable license fee.
- Meeting performance benchmarks, such as maintaining uptime and task completion rates above 95%.

## Example Tier Use Cases

1. **LN1 (Basic Tier)**: Ideal for individual operators starting with minimal infrastructure.
2. **LN2 (Intermediate Tier)**: Suitable for small enterprises scaling operations and contributing to core validation tasks.
3. **LN3 (Advanced Tier)**: Designed for operators managing multiple nodes with advanced setups.
4. **LN4 (Enterprise Tier)**: Tailored for enterprise-scale operations requiring robust infrastructure and contributing heavily to network security and consensus.

## Key Considerations

- **Performance Metrics**: Maintaining consistent uptime (>99%) and high task accuracy is essential for maximizing rewards.
- **Scalability**: Operators are encouraged to scale their hardware and operations as they progress through the tiers.
- **Support**: Higher-tier nodes receive dedicated support and advanced monitoring tools to optimize performance.
