# Task Management System

The DataHive network implements a sophisticated task distribution system for [node operators](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md) based on tier level, performance metrics, and hardware capabilities.

## Task Types

**Core Operations**
- Legal document indexing
- Data validation and verification
- Compliance monitoring
- Network consensus participation
- Smart contract execution

## Task Allocation

| Node Type | Weekly Tasks | Complexity Level | Reward Multiplier |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [LN4](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln4.md) | 5,000+ | Highest | 3.0x |
| [LN3](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln3.md) | 3,500-4,000 | Advanced | 2.5x |
| [LN2](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln2.md) | 2,500-3,000 | Intermediate | 2.0x |
| [LN1](/docs/onboarding/tiers/ln1.md) | 500-2,000 | Basic | 1.0x |

## Performance Metrics

**Task Evaluation**
- Completion rate
- Processing speed
- Validation accuracy
- Network contribution
- Response time

## Task Distribution

**Assignment Factors**
- Node tier level
- Hardware capabilities
- Historical performance
- Network status
- Geographic location

## Reward Structure

**Compensation Model**
- Base rewards per task
- Performance multipliers
- Quality bonuses
- Consensus participation rewards
- Network contribution incentives

*Note: Task allocation and rewards scale with node tier level and performance metrics. Higher-tier nodes receive more complex tasks and greater rewards.*
