## Uptime

Uptime measures the percentage of time a node remains active and operational within the network.
- **Importance**: High uptime ensures consistent availability and reliability.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use [performance dashboards](/docs/onboarding/dashboard.md) to track real-time uptime.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Ensure stable power and internet connections.
  - Regularly maintain hardware to prevent outages.

---

## Task Completion

Task completion evaluates the percentage of assigned tasks successfully executed within the required timeframe.
- **Importance**: High completion rates demonstrate reliability and efficiency.
- **Optimization Tips**:
  - Prioritize tasks based on deadlines.
  - Monitor task queues through the [node management dashboard](/docs/onboarding/nodes.md).

---

## Validation Accuracy

Validation accuracy measures the correctness of validated transactions or data processed by a node.
- **Importance**: Ensures the integrity and trustworthiness of the network.
- **Improvement Strategies**:
  - Conduct regular performance audits.
  - Use automated validation tools to reduce errors.

---

## Response Time

Response time tracks how quickly a node processes and responds to network requests.
- **Importance**: Low latency improves user experience and network efficiency.
- **Optimization Tips**:
  - Upgrade hardware to reduce processing delays.
  - Optimize software configurations for faster task execution.

---

## Real-Time Monitoring

Performance metrics are updated continuously and available through the [monitoring dashboard](/docs/onboarding/monitoring.md). Alerts notify operators of potential issues, enabling proactive management.

**Alert Types**:
1. **Performance Degradation**: Triggers when metrics fall below thresholds.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Warns of CPU, memory, or bandwidth overuse.
3. **Security Events**: Alerts for suspicious activity or unauthorized access.

---

## Impact on Rewards and Ranking

1. **Rewards**: Performance metrics influence reward calculations, including:
   - [Staking bonuses](/docs/onboarding/staking/rewards.md).
   - [Achievement milestones](/docs/onboarding/rewards/achievements.md).
2. **Ranking**: Metrics determine leaderboard positions and [TGE participation multipliers](/docs/onboarding/tge/multipliers.md).

---

## Tips for Maintaining High Performance

1. Regularly update software and apply [security patches](/docs/onboarding/security/patches.md).
2. Monitor resource usage to prevent overloading.
3. Use automated tools for task management and validation accuracy checks.
4. Engage with support channels for troubleshooting and optimization assistance.
