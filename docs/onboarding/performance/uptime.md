# Uptime Performance

Uptime is a critical performance metric in the DataHive network, measuring the consistency and reliability of a node's operation. High uptime ensures the network's resilience, efficiency, and trustworthiness, directly impacting rewards and operator rankings.

## Uptime Requirements

| **Tier** | **Minimum Uptime** |
|----------|---------------------|
| LN1      | 95%                |
| LN2      | 98%                |
| LN3      | 99%                |
| LN4      | 99.9%              |

*Note: Falling below the minimum uptime threshold can result in penalties or reduced task allocations.*

## Importance of High Uptime

1. **Network Stability**:
   - High uptime ensures nodes are consistently available to process tasks and participate in consensus.

2. **Task Allocation**:
   - Nodes with higher uptime are prioritized for task distribution.

3. **Reward Eligibility**:
   - Maintaining uptime above the target threshold maximizes eligibility for [performance rewards](/docs/onboarding/rewards/system.md).

4. **Reputation**:
   - Operators with consistently high uptime improve their standing in the [network leaderboard](/docs/onboarding/performance/ranking.md).

## Monitoring Uptime

1. **Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Access uptime statistics through the [monitoring dashboard](/docs/onboarding/monitoring.md).
   - Receive alerts for performance drops.

2. **Automated Alerts**:
   - Notifications for downtime or degraded performance via email or SMS.

3. **Historical Data**:
   - Review uptime trends to identify areas for improvement.

## Strategies to Maintain High Uptime

1. **Reliable Infrastructure**:
   - Use stable and high-speed internet connections.
   - Invest in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to prevent downtime during outages.

2. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Schedule hardware and software updates to minimize unexpected failures.
   - Monitor resource utilization to ensure the node operates efficiently.

3. **Redundancy Planning**:
   - Set up backup nodes or failover systems to maintain operations during disruptions.

4. **24/7 Monitoring**:
   - Utilize monitoring tools to detect and address issues promptly.

## Penalties for Low Uptime

| **Uptime Level**      | **Impact**                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 95%-98%              | Reduced rewards and ranking penalties. |
| 90%-95%              | Downgraded task allocation priority.   |
| Below 90%            | Suspension of task distribution.       |

## Incentives for High Uptime

1. **Performance Bonuses**:
   - Nodes maintaining uptime above 99.9% receive additional bonuses.

2. **Priority Tasks**:
   - High-uptime nodes are assigned complex and higher-paying tasks.

3. **Leaderboard Advantages**:
   - Improved ranking on the [network leaderboard](/docs/onboarding/performance/ranking.md).
